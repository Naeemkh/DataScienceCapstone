##### Summary

This web application is developed as Data Science Capstone by Johns Hopkins University. I used three sources of data including News, Blog, and Twitter data corpus. I generated 1-5 grams data set and predict the next word based on those ngrams. The program recive the input and reformat it into an appropriate string to predict the next word. I used Katz-Backoff model to back off for unobserved words. The first tab is a phone style presentation of the application. The application recieve the input data instantanusly and predict and print out three most probable values. Second tab reports the 10 most probable words with their probability. Third tab plots 200 most probable words in a word cloud. Due to rendering time, I use submit button in second and third tab to avoid unnecessary plotting which can put delay at the final response. 

The applicaiton is uploaded at the Shiny website, and documents are uploaded at the Gituhub repository.
